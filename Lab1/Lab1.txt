2.1 - The critical sequence of accesses which may have a larger impact on the performance of the system is the macroblock processing.

2.3.1.1 - Compulsory miss: A miss that happens after the first access to a block (e.g. after booting), so it must be brought into the cache.
          Capacity miss: A miss that happens when the cache cannot contain all blocks needed for a program and they end up being discarded before the access (more common in associative mapped caches)
          Conflict miss: A miss that happens when two or more memory addresses map to the same cache block (more common in direct mapped caches, fixable by using a fully associative cache)

(extra)
capacity -> guardei 5 coisas, 4 foram substituidas pq nao havia espaco na cache e tentei ler denovo as 5 coisas, deu miss
conflit -> guardei no 0x0 , outro tbm guardou no 0x0, fui ao 0x0 e ja nao estava la o que guardei inicialmente

2.3.1.2 When receiving data:
        - Write-through: Both the cache and the memory are updated
        - Write-back: Only the cache is updated. The memory is updated only when the data is replaced in cache.
        - Write-allocate: The data is loaded from the memory into the cache, updated and finally sent back to the memory (just before its replacement when used with write-back - more commonly - or immediately when used with write-through)
        - Write-around: Only the main memory is updated (normally used when the data is not relevant at the moment)

2.3.2
    a)  Device       Technology     Access Time [ns]                 Price [€ / MByte]
        Cache L1     SRAM (on-chip) 2 × [0.7 + 0.35 × log 2 (#ways)] 9
        Frame Memory SDRAM          140                              0.01

        SRAM has a capacity of 128 kBytes
        Max cost: 0.018€ (for both cache L1 and frame memory)

        1 MB - 1024 KB 
        X MB - 128 KB
        X = 128/1024 = 1/8 MB

        The price for the frame memory is 1/8*0.01 = 0.00125€

        Therefore we have 0.01675€ to spend in Cache L1

        9 €       - 1 Mb
        0.01675 € - X MB
        X = 0.01675/9 = 0.00186(1) MB = 1.905(7) KB

        Because L1_size = 2^MAX, the closest value to 1.905(7) KB is 1024 B = 2^10 Bytes with Max=10

    d)
        Trade offer between cost and average miss-rate 
        Cost = Price x Miss-Rate
